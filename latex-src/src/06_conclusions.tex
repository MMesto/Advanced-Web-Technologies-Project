\section{\textbf{Conclusions}}\label{sec:conclusions}

While developing RBB-Quiz plugin, we have explored
MPAT and found it as very easy to use platform for HbbTV
applications. MPAT allows programmers to design interactive
applications while not manipulating with WordPress core,
which is the underlying environment of MPAT. MPAT also
provides a very convenient environment for testing applications.
Applications built with MPAT can either be viewed on
a Smart TV that supports the HbbTV standard versions named
above or, alternatively, MPAT can be previewed on the Internet
browser with Firefox  \footnote{https://mpat-eu.github.io/handbook/}.

 

Overall RBB-Quiz plugin development process was a great
learning experience for developing HbbTV applications. Some
of its features provide great power programmers like Content
Components, Navigation models and its integration with
WordPress\cite{handbook}.




MPAT installation and setting up the working environment
was a bit difficult and tricky, but when we were done with
the Installation process, Then MPAT power makes it easy to
plan and design applications.RBB-Quiz plugin idea was a bit
difficult to absorb at the start, but MPAT made it very easy
and we did successful final demonstrations by fulfilling all the
use case requirements.
