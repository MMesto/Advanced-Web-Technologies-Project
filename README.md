Abstract—HbbTV ( Hybrid broadcast broadband TV) is the
standard for the broadcast and broadband services, which also
provides customers to interact with their TV. The latest version of
HbbTV 2.0, which was released in 2015. This latest release added
some new features like HTML5, compatibility of companion
screens and multi device synchronization. In our project well
be using MPAT as HbbTV development environment. Which is
basically a WordPress based applications and provides easy to
use development environment for even programing beginners. In
this project well be developing an MPAT based plugin, that will
allow viewers of ”Jede Antwort zhlt!” to play quiz along the TV
show. As the theme of quiz show is to present multiple choice
questions. TV viewers will be able to select correct answers, and
their scores will be shown on screen. Which will make show more
interesting for show audience at home. And behind the scenes,
there will be another actor (editor), who will interact with this
application. An admin panel will be show on the editor side, who
will be able to enter the numbers of questions, time stamps and
score for each question. This plugin will provide synchronisation
in such a way that it will only show components on screen when
there will be questions on screen.
