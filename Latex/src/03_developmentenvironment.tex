\section{\textbf{Setting up the development environment }}\label{sec:relatedwork}


For ensuring to work smoothly we had to set up our
machines in a proper way. Following are the steps we followed
for setting up the environment in the different operating system
and different web browser.


\subsection{Installation Process for Windows OS}
 Download XAMPP for Windows Operating system.

 
\begin{enumerate}

 \item Download MPAT-Core from GitHub link
(https://github.com/MPAT-eu).
 \item Install XAMPP by running the .exe file.
\item Extract MPAT-Core to xampp/htdocs/.
\item Run XAMPP and start Apache and MySQL.
\item Start XAMPP Shell.
\item Navigate to MPAT-core-master directory.
\item Run ”php composer.phar install” command.
\item Open localhost/phpmyadmin/ in web browser and create
wordpress database.
\item Change .env.example to .env file in MPAT-core-master
directory then change its content accordingly and Generate
key from https://roots.io/salts.html and add them
in .env file.
\item Open localhost/MPAT-core-master/web/ (if this links
open then everything is good).
\item Now open sub-directory wp/wp-admin inside ’web’
directory (localhost/MPAT-core-master/web/wp/wpadmin/).
It will ask you to install wordpress.
\item After that login to Wordpress
\item Then goto Plugins and activate all plugins and update
them if needed.
\item For accessing the timeline feature of MPAT, activate
multisite on WordPress.
\end{enumerate}
 
  
 
\subsection{Installation Process for Ubuntu}

\begin{enumerate}
 
\item Download installation package for Ubuntu Operating
system.
\item Download MPAT-Core from GitHub link
(https://github.com/MPAT-eu)
\item Make sure the installation package is executable.
\item Navigate to the downloaded package and change the
mode,e.g.
chmod 755 xampp-linux-x64-7.2.10-0-installer.run
\item Confirm the execute permission by
ls -l xampp-linux-x64-7.2.10-0-installer.run
\item Launch the Setup Wizard by
sudo ./[package name] and finish the installation
\item Extract MPAT-Core to xampp/htdocs/
\item Start LAMPP by
sudo /opt/lampp/lampp start
\item Navigate to MPAT-core-master directory
\item Run ”php composer.phar install” command
\item Open localhost/phpmyadmin/ in web browser and create
wordpress database.
\item Change .env.example to .env file in MPAT-core-master
directory then change its content accordingly and Generate
key from https://roots.io/salts.html and add them
in .env file
\item Open localhost/MPAT-core-master/web/ (if this links
open then everything is good)
\item Now open sub-directory wp/wp-admin inside ’web’
directory (localhost/MPAT-core-master/web/wp/wpadmin/).
It will ask you to install wordpress.
\item After that login to Wordpress
\item Then go to Plugins and activate all plugins and update
them if needed.
\item For accessing the timeline feature of MPAT, activate
multisite on WordPress.
\end{enumerate}






\subsection{Browser Setting}

MPAT can be used on almost all the browsers, where
WordPress is supported. Any standards Internet browser like
Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox or MS Internet Explorer is
required to use the MPAT editor tool and to start creating
HbbTV applications.
In order to preview the HbbTV applications , Mozilla
Firefox v51.0.1 as well as the Firefox Add-on FireHbbTV
v1.3.20 are needed. This Add-on must be switched on in order
to preview the HbbTV application and must be switched off
in order to edit the application with MPAT.
To achieve a better workflow and efficient development
environment, we configured FireHbbTV only on FireFox.
Google Chrome will only be used for the development and it
will not be having FireHbbTV addon. In case if the FireHbbTV
addon will be active on the browser, where well be working.
Then well always need to stop FireHbbTV addon, because it
changes the standard display of browser [2].
