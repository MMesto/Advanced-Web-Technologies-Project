basically a WordPress based applications and provides easy to
use development environment for even programing beginners. In
this project well be developing an MPAT based plugin, that will
allow viewers of ”Jede Antwort zhlt!” to play quiz along the TV
show. As the theme of quiz show is to present multiple choice
questions. TV viewers will be able to select correct answers, and
their scores will be shown on screen. Which will make show more
interesting for show audience at home. And behind the scenes,
there will be another actor (editor), who will interact with this
application. An admin panel will be show on the editor side, who
will be able to enter the numbers of questions, time stamps and
score for each question. This plugin will provide synchronisation
in such a way that it will only show components on screen when
there will be questions on screen.
